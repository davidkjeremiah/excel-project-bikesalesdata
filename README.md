Excel Fun Project showing Bike Sales Data - Interactive Dashboard

I analyzed Bikeshare sales data collected from https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx

Downloaded 'Excel Project Dataset.xlsx' file to local directory

Wrangled 'Excel Project Dataset.xlsx' - removed duplicates and standard the 'Martial Status' and 'Gender' Columns

Analyzed 'Excel Project Dataset.xlsx' - created pivot tables, generated a plot and saved it together in a Dashboard.
